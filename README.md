'My Reads' project created as part of the React Developer Nanodegree at Udacity (https://www.udacity.com/).

This project will let you have a starter development thinking about react, while challenging you to think the 'react way'.

It uses React.js (https://reactjs.org/) library to abstract and make easier for developers to build User Interfaces, NPM or Yarn to manage dependencies and some CSS, already provided by Udacity.

Some third-party libraries was used, as follows:

Pure CSS Loaders (https://loading.io/css/), that provide easy ways to implement loading scenes for the application.
PropTypes (https://www.npmjs.com/package/prop-types), that provide development-time functionality to match the requested props with the given ones, throwing errors if some of them is not matching and alerting the developer to fix it.

Instructions to get up and running:

1- Clone this project, (ex: type in the terminal: git clone https://github.com/gmargutti/reactnd-project-myreads-starter.git)
2- Navigate to this project's root folder with the terminal and type 'npm install'. If you don't have NPM installed yet, you can download it here: https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm
3- After having npm installed and 'npm install' executed, it's time to run 'npm start' and the react script will set everything up and running for you. A new tab will be open with the react application.
