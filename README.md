'My Reads' project created as part of the React Developer Nanodegree at Udacity (https://www.udacity.com/).

This project will let you have a starter development thinking about react, while challenging you to think the 'react way'.

It uses React.js (https://reactjs.org/) library to abstract and make easier for developers to build User Interfaces, NPM or Yarn to manage dependencies and some CSS, already provided by Udacity.

Some third-party libraries was used, as follows:

Pure CSS Loaders (https://loading.io/css/), that provide easy ways to implement loading scenes for the application.
PropTypes (https://www.npmjs.com/package/prop-types), that provide development-time functionality to match the requested props with the given ones, throwing errors if some of them is not matching and alerting the developer to fix it.
